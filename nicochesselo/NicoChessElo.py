# Welcome to NicoChessElo

This application is a learning project created to unerstand the usage of APIs
and the Python-Snowflake connection.

## How does it work

The data is retreived either from a PGN file (obtained from the
[Lichess Database](https://database.lichess.org/)). It can also retrieve
specific games from a user in the Get Data page and visualize statistics of the
stored games in the Visualize Data page.

The data is stored in a [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/) account
that can be accessed by the code. The
structre of the database is pretty simple and can be seen next.
